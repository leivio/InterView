# Given a byte[] array, write a function byte[] readBits(int numBits) starting from LSB towards MSB. for ex, 
# if function called to read 3 bits, read the last 3 bits from the byte and mask the remaining bits with zero. 
# The algorithm has to be designed in such a way that we should read the bits based on the given input and save remaining 
# bits for subsequent reads.
